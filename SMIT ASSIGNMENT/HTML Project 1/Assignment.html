<center><u><b><h1>CREATE A WEBSITE USING HTML WEBSITE</h1></b></u></center>

<center><p> HTML is a standardised system for tagging text files that creates the structure for just about every page that we find and use on the web. It’s HTML that adds in page breaks, paragraphs, bold lettering, italics, and more. HTML works to build this structure by using tags that tell browsers what to do with text. 

    For example, to make a word appear bold, we put that word between the following tags <strong>bold</strong>. The first tag indicates the start of the word(s) that we want to bold, and the closing tag(/) indicates where we want the bold to stop. It’s the basis for pretty much every page on the web. If you are learning to code, this is the place to start. </p></center>

    <center><h2>makdir public_html</h2></center>
    <p>After this change your directory to this new directory called  <q>public html</q></p>

    <center><h2>CD Public_html</h2></center>
    <p>If you want to,you can make other directories one for all the web pages that you make,and one for all of the graphics that you have.Follow of the same stage as above to do this. <br>Next, you need to think of a filename for your page (this is not a title, but what will be in the URL).A common filename for a main web page, is <q>index.</q>Once you have decided on this,add <q>.html</q> to the end of it.Then type(i.e)</p>

    <center><h2>Pico index.html</h2></center>
    <p>Of course,use your page <sup>,</sup> filename.instead of this one.Next you need to gain some knowledge of the many HTML commands.Lucky for you,I <sup>,</sup> ve already gotten of the some basis commands for you.Follow the index below, to decide what to  put on your page, and how to do it.Once you <sup>,</sup> ve gotten started,exit your page.You can do this by pressing <strong>control-x.</strong>Then you need to type:   </p>

    <center><h2>chmod 744 index.html</h2></center>
    <p>Only do with the filename of your page.You only need to do this the very first time that you leave your web page.This command will make sure that nobody else can delete your page.You will need to do this to any other pages that you make in the future.Then, look at your page on.</p>
